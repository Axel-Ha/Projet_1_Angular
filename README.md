## Description

This project is a starter code for the Angular course. It is a simple application that displays the olympic participations by country. 
You can click on a country to display the olympic data corresponding to it.

The data is stored inside a json file (`src/assets/mock/olympic.json`) and is loaded using the `HttpClient` module.

## Prerequisites

You need to install your node_modules before starting the project (`npm install or npm i`).

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
