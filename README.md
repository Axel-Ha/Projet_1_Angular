# OlympicGamesStarter

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.1.3.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.

## Where to start

I continued to use the architecture you gave me :

- `pages` folder: contains components used for routing
- `core` folder: contains the business logic (`services` and `models` folders)

I created typescripts methods inside the `models` & `services` folders that I use inside the components.

There are 3 main components : 

- 'home.component' which is the home page. 
- 'country.component' which is the second page that will detail the country results.
- 'not-found.component' which is the error and redirection page.
